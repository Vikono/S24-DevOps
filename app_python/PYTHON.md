# Task 1

## Framework choice justification
I chose FastAPI as a framework for this python application, because it introduces simplicity in development API and also provides an opportunity to create API documentation automatically.

# Task 2

## Best practices 
1. Separation of business logic from other parts, which is essential for future scaling of the application.
2. Usage of linting (flake8, black formatter) for consistancy with PEP8 standard.
3. Unit testing for clarifying the corretness of different parts of application independently.
4. Usage of virtual environment to separate packages from global environment and be consistent with the packages' versions.
